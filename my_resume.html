                        <p>
                            Hi, my name is Dhanachote Weerachatsakul, I graduated since 2021 from Assumption University faculty is Bachelor's degree Administration majored in Hospitality and Tourism management.
                            <br>After graduate, I was interesting at Data Analytics where I heared from my best friend. He told me that Data Analytics is the most important role to analyze problem and slove to help business growing.
                            By the way, it is far from my knowledge that I was studying at my university. Because of, as a data analytics role you need to know coding language.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong><u>For example</u></strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li> Google Sheet, Excel </li>
                                <li> SQL </li>
                                <li> R language </li>
                                <li> Python </li>
                            </ul>
                            AS you see, these languages is not  related in univeristy. Therefore, I enrolled Data Analytics online courses from <strong>Coursera</strong> and <strong>DataCamp</strong>,
                            you will see my certificate folder form my link. Lastly, before to explain about my experiences, I got the certificate from Data Science BootCamp since 2023, 
                            teacheing by <a href="https://datarockie.com/" target="_blank">DataRockie school</a> and this is his name and profile as a link <a href="https://datarockie.com/hello/" target="_blank">Kasidis Satangmongkol.</a>
